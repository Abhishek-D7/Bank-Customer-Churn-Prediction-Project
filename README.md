# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Project

✨Are you curious about the future of customer behavior in the banking industry?
✨Excited about the potential of predictive analytics?

In my latest project, I explored the dynamic domain of Bank customer churn prediction . Core Python formed the foundation for the entire implementation, while Numpy facilitated efficient numerical operations. Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library, played a crucial role in handling and processing the dataset. The visual representation of data and model performance was accomplished using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Logistic Regression is a powerful algorithm for binary classification tasks, making it suitable for predicting whether a customer will churn or not. The custom implementation involved defining the logistic function (sigmoid) as the activation function and employing gradient descent for optimization.

The sigmoid activation function played a crucial role in transforming raw model outputs into probabilities, providing a clear threshold for classifying customers as potential churners or non-churners. The project's success in achieving a remarkable accuracy score highlighted the efficacy of the custom model in identifying potential churners accurately.
